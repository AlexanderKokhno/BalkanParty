They claim the increased instability, politically, socially an economically makes the extension of the debt deadline unfeasible. We however, simply don't have the funds to repay the PRC. \nThe PRC has come to us with an alternative proposal, understanding that we are simply incapable of paying back our loans. Some even point out how the PRC has seemingly known this would happen, based off their reaction. King Zog is to step down and a democratic governemnt is to take power. \n\nWhile the Zog was considering these terms, a crowd of heavily armed revolutionaries from the newly leagalized communist party suorrounded his residence, forcing an acceptance. Now it only remians to be seen how the king will retire."

Within hours, the streets across the country were home to countless battles. As the political violence increased, firearms began to be fired. In mere hours, local militias and armed mobs joined the fray, leading casualties to mount in the hundreds as the streets became a warzone. \n\nThe days end saw the country effectivly split into two as the political violence became a full civil war. Supports to the cause have been called upon over the border, drawing in additional combatants. \n\nThe streets run red with Crimson blood."

Across Ankara, a faction mobilizes, prepared to enact their long-awaited plans to seize the Turkish nation for themselves. Nihâl Atsiz and his faction of Turanists have grown powerful with the turmoil brought upon by recent circumstances, aiming to overthrow the Inonu government, which he has accused of working with Turkish communists. As the rumbling of trucks approached key government buildings within Ankara, the fate of Turkey shall be decided in the next few hours."

After several minutes of this, Inonu himself was dragged to the center of the assembly and placed firmly infront of Atsiz, who quickly drew a pistol and fired three rounds into his skull.

Over the hours, reinforcements would be called, and the rebels would be killed, but this was merely the beginning of the Turanist troubles."

Some in our cabinet suggest utilizing democratic forces and influence in order to crack down upon the threats to our state, whilst others are concerned over the influence this may give democratic forces.

This safehouse in particular seemed much more highly staffed and guarded than others they had raided, lending credibility to the theory that Atsiz was here. As they cleared out the rest of the safehouse, they came to a large metal door at the end of a long hallway, and prepared to bust it open. \n\nInside, Atsiz pulled back the slide of his pistol and points the barrel directly under his chin, slowly pushing down on the trigger as the door behind him becomes more and more ajar."

The judge stated blankly, with a similar lack of reaction from the rest of the court, as everyone had already known what his fate would be from the moment they walked in the courtroom. \n\nFour Turkish army units grabbed him by the shoulder and proceeded to drag him to a hastily set up gallows on the outskirts of the court, where he was placed upon a stool and had a rope tied around his neck. \n\nBut Atsiz did not react, he had not said a word during the trial, and only when the stool fell out from under him, and the sudden force broke his neck on impact, did he let out a final, choked gurgle."

As the noise reached it's loudest point, the door swung open, and Inonu along with several generals moved into the halls of the assembly, backed by the dozens of soldiers now entering the room behind them. As the soldiers arranged the members of the assembly into their seats and Inonu walked up to the center of the assembly, everyone within the room waited for him to speak, which he did after a minute, uttering several key words."

"Yeah, after we got that bastard Atsiz they've been on the run, though-" They stopped talking as they approached their destination, with eight soldiers exiting the truck and moving up to a small building nestled deep in the countryside.

Turkish army units moved to different houses and locations throughout the city, arresting key targets and transporting them to military prisons across Turkey. Indeed, it seems that Inonu has secured his checkmate over interal opposition, allowing for him and his clique to control the Turkish nation, unburdened by opposition. \n\nInside the halls of the former assembly, Inonu and his clique surveyed maps of the Turkish lands, war plans and other documents, preparing for the next phase of their rule. They knew that despite their victory, their work had only just begun, and in time, they would need to revitalize the Turkish economy, take back their lost lands and create a truly Kemalist republic."

But they were not here to place Germanic sycophants in power. No, they were here to carry out something that was necessary, which was the dissolution of the Inonu government, before he could transform the country into his personal dictatorship. \n\nAs the trucks arrived at their destination, and soldiers marched into the building, Inonu's forces found themselves outnumbered and outgunned, with the garrison protecting him and his clique surrendering after a half hour of fighting. As for Inonu and his clique, they would be arrested and transported to special prisons, from which the date of their trial would be decided."

Of course, this is merely the beginning of our road, and the path ahead will be long and difficult. But if our will is strong, and our people determined, then we shall triumph!" The crowd erupted into cheers and clapping after the conclusion of Nihal's speech, these sounds being the only thing audible in the plaza. \n\nAll across Turkey, the last of the communist cells were being flushed out and systematically destroyed, with the extermination of all democratic and communist Turkish figures that were unable to flee being carried out. A new dawn has shined upon Turan."

 turkey.18.desc:0 "It all went wrong, so quickly. With the Turanist forces being utterly exhausted after their recapture of key points during the civil war, a fresh wave of international volunteers and Soviet aid would be the catalyst for a renewed counterattack against Turanist forces. With the recapture of key cities in the East and the West, Ankara was soon encircled by rebel forces, where they proceeded to enter into a protracted siege against the Turanist forces dug in. After a week of intense fighting, a barrage of artillery destroyed the former assembly building, ending the last pockets of resistance in Ankara and incapacitating Atsiz, who was swiftly apprehended by communist forces. With the collapse of the Turanist government, the Istanbul garrison soon surrendered, ending all organized Turanist resistance against the new communist regime."
