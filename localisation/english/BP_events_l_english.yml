 austria.1.t:0 "Election of 1936"
 austria.1.desc:0 "The Time has come for a decisive choice of national policy and party. Three candidates are up for the masses to choose, or atleast so shall they believe. \n\nWill the last emperor of Austria Hungary, Archduke Robert of Austria Este, return to politics? \nShall the nationalists carry out their dreams of a Greater Austria?  \nOr perhaps... the communists will secure the election through dubious means? \n\nI consider it completely unimportant who in the party will vote, or how; but what is extraordinarily important is this — who will count the votes, and how. -Joseph Stalin; The Memoirs of Stalin's Former Secretary by Boris Bazhanov"
 austria.1.a:0 "The Archduke will rebuild the glory of the past!"
 austria.1.b:0 "Don't be stupid, be a smarty; come and join your Nazi Party!"
 austria.1.c:0 "Let a KPO member guard the vote box."
